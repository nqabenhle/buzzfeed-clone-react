# BuzzFeed Clone - React

I built this project following [Ania Kubow's tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVd90WYo3Hs)

## How to run the app

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your local machine if you haven't already.

2. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the app project using the `cd` command.

3. Install the dependencies required to run the app by running `npm install` or `yarn` in the command prompt or terminal window. This will download and install all the necessary packages listed in your package.json file.

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running `npm start` or `yarn start` in the command prompt or terminal window. This will start the development server and launch the app in a web browser.
